## Getting Started

### Color Styles

You can find the different color stylesheets in the /css/colors project directory.  Changing the color style of the template can be done by altering the custom css path in the header of the HTML template (index.html). 

For example, to change the color style to black and blue, simply alter the custom css path in the HTML header to:
```
<link rel="StyleSheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="css/colors/color-blackandblue.css">
```

### Project Images

To change the project images, replace the files in the img/portfolio project directory, and refer to them appropriately in the HTML project section.

### Resume Document

To change the resume, replace the file in the documents/resume project directory.

### JavaScript

The JavaScript files are located in the /js project directory, including the BootStrap JS components. The ekko-lightbox.js contains the script needed for using the lightbox for the projects section on the portfolio template.  The custom.js contains the addition JavaScript used for the template that can be altered to fit your needs.
